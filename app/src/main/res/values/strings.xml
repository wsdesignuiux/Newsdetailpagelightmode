They won’t make you go blind, and your doctor isn’t going to worry about your health if he or she hears that you’re spending a lot of time in front of them. However, you might feel uncomfortable after a long time in front of a backlight, and you might even experience the symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome, a fancy name for the eye strain and discomfort monitors can cause.</string>
